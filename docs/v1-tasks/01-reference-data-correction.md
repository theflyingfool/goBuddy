*Part of the [V1 Task Breakdown](README.md). Previous: [0. Already decided](00-context.md). Next: [2. Data-safety net](02-data-safety-net.md).*
*Roadmap context: [Theme 2 — Reference-data corrections](../v1-roadmap/02-reference-data-corrections.md).*

## 1. Reference-data correction pass

*Do this before any real device holds personal data — slugs are immutable by
design, so fixes here are free today and permanent debt later.*

- [x] Fix Necrozma fusion names: swap "Dawn Mane"/"Dusk Wings" → **Dusk Mane**
  (Solgaleo fusion) / **Dawn Wings** (Lunala fusion). `scripts/ingest/build-reference.ts`
  or the Forms CSV source, wherever the name string originates.
- [x] Purge phantom "Standard" form rows for: Deoxys, Giratina, Shaymin,
  Zygarde, Hoopa, Genesect, Basculin, Oricorio, Sinistea, Urshifu, Enamorus,
  Furfrou, Vivillon, Maushold, Dudunsparce. Extend `NO_STANDARD_FORM_NAMES` in
  `scripts/ingest/pokemon-facts.ts` (same mechanism already used for Unown).
  **Migrate the `shiny_available`/shiny-personal flag from the phantom row to
  the real default form** as part of the same change — verify per species.
  Done: for the 11 species with one clear default sub-row (Deoxys' "Normal",
  Furfrou's "Natural", ...) the phantom's Shiny flag moved to that row. For
  Basculin, Oricorio, and Vivillon — no single default among their color/
  pattern variants — the flag was conservatively copied onto every variant
  rather than picking one arbitrarily; still worth a manual per-form Shiny
  pass later (see the comment above `NO_STANDARD_FORM_NAMES`).
- [x] Fix gen-9 slug/name typos: `ogrepon`→`ogerpon`, `fezanipiti`→`fezandipiti`,
  `sinistchai`→`sinistcha` **and its dex number 1012→1013** (currently
  duplicates Poltchageist). Display-name fix: "Pharoah"→"Pharaoh" (Furfrou).
- [x] Add Crowned Sword Zacian / Crowned Shield Zamazenta forms (in GO since
  GO Fest 2025). Shiny available on both (owner-confirmed); Shadow/Dynamax
  left at the species' existing (unavailable) values pending confirmation.
- [x] Add the six missing `mega_variant` rows: Mega Pidgeot, Mega Kangaskhan,
  Mega Mewtwo X, Mega Mewtwo Y, Primal Kyogre, Primal Groudon. Note: current
  data has **zero** Mewtwo mega rows and `species.canMegaEvolve: false` for
  Mewtwo — fix `can_mega_evolve` too, not just add the variant rows.
- [ ] Tighten Gigantamax availability/shiny-availability gating to GO's actual
  rollout (all 32 canonical G-max species are currently marked available,
  shiny included — GO's rollout since late 2024 is a subset).
  **Deliberately deferred**: owner doesn't have the current rollout list
  handy; okay leaving all 32 marked available for now. Revisit when that
  list is available.
- [x] Correct the "Mega Dimension" documentation error and its downstream
  filter bug. Fixed via the §7 image-pipeline work (unrelated task, found
  along the way): `build-reference.ts`'s mega-variety filter required a
  mainline `version_group` (`x-y`/`omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire`), which
  structurally can never match a GO-exclusive Mega — it was silently
  rejecting real, current GO megas for Dragonite/Skarmory/Raichu/Malamar/
  Victreebel/Falinks (all confirmed real by the owner, all only ever tagged
  under PokeAPI's "Mega Dimension" pack). Fixed to trust the GO tracker CSV
  for availability and use whatever variety PokeAPI exposes for variant
  shape (plain/X/Y/Primal), regardless of pack. **Re-verified the Uxie/
  Mesprit/Azelf/Malamar/Falinks question this item asked for** — owner
  confirmed (2026-07-10) all five are still bogus tracker entries despite
  Mega Dimension listing them (no supporting art exists for any of them),
  *plus* two more the same fix surfaced that weren't on this list at all:
  Butterfree and Lugia, also confirmed bogus. All seven marked unavailable
  in the tracker CSV. Audino's claim was already fine (`audino-mega` +
  `canMegaEvolve: true` both already present, nothing to fix there). Ingestion
  comments corrected to say "official *Legends: Z-A* DLC," not fan content.
  Full writeup: `docs/costume-lookup-verification.md`'s "Cross-cutting"
  section (filed there since that's where the discovery happened, not
  because it's a costume issue).
- [ ] **D7**: confirm the ~11 costume code identifications against Bulbapedia
  sprite images before slugging (Cap Pikachu O=Original/W=World; Flying
  Pikachu Fly/Fly5/FlyOkinawa/FlyGreen/FlyPurple/FlyOrange/FlyRed — see
  `docs/v1-roadmap/02-reference-data-corrections.md` §7 for the proposed names). Apply once confirmed.
- [x] Fix the lucky-IV-floor comment in `docs/data-model.md` (~10/10/10 →
  12/12/12; non-load-bearing, just a stale comment). Done as part of the
  docs reorg pass.
- [x] Once [§ 9](06-performance-and-quality-infra.md)'s slug-stability check
  script exists, run it against this pass's output before merging, to
  confirm nothing was accidentally renamed instead of corrected-in-place.
  The script was built in §2 (`scripts/ingest/check-slug-stability.ts`,
  not yet merged at the time of this pass) — ran it manually against this
  branch's diff from `master`: all 28 disappeared form slugs and 3
  disappeared species slugs match this pass's documented, intentional
  renames/purges above, nothing unaccounted for.
- [x] **New, found via owner's manual `ingest:csv:export` review**: Armored
  Mewtwo was double-modeled — once correctly as a real Forme
  (`mewtwo-armored-unknown`, from the Forms-CSV/PokeAPI pipeline) and again
  as a costume on the Standard form (`mewtwo-standard-armored-mewtwo-unknown`,
  from `parse-event-pokemon.ts`'s Bulbapedia scrape, which doesn't
  distinguish genuine alternate Formes from real costumes in Bulbapedia's
  "Event Pokémon (GO)" list). Added a `NOT_ACTUALLY_A_COSTUME` exclusion set
  (same pattern as `NO_STANDARD_FORM_NAMES`) to prevent recurrence, and
  manually removed the already-imported duplicate form + its `formTypes` row
  from `reference.json` (the CSV import path only inserts/updates, never
  deletes). Checked for the same pattern elsewhere first — Pumpkaboo/
  Gourgeist's "Spooky Festival (Small/Average/Large)" looked similar but is
  legitimate (a real costume applied per size variant, already a documented
  known case in `parse-event-pokemon.ts`). Owner is continuing a manual
  review of the Coverage Report for further issues; more may follow.
- [x] **Follow-up systematic scan** (dex-number/slug duplicate check,
  referential-integrity check across all reference tables, a full read of
  every remaining `possible-bogus-form`/`missing-types`/`unverified-gender`
  gap): found and fixed 4 more real bugs, all confirmed against the cached
  PokeAPI varieties before changing anything:
  - **Grimer/Muk**: the tracker CSV mislabeled their real Alolan regional
    variant as "Galarian" (PokeAPI only has `grimer-alola`/`muk-alola`, no
    Galar variety) — both species were missing their real Alolan form
    entirely while carrying a fake Galarian one. Renamed in the Forms CSV;
    types now correctly resolve to Poison/Dark.
  - **Slowking**: same mislabeling in reverse — tracker said "Paldean"
    (doesn't exist for Slowking) instead of "Galarian" (real, evolves from
    Galarian Slowpoke; PokeAPI only has `slowking-galar`). Renamed; types
    now correctly resolve to Poison/Psychic.
  - **Persian**: had a "Galarian" sub-row with no valid basis at all —
    Persian's only real regional variant is Alolan (already correctly
    present separately; PokeAPI has only `persian-alola`). Deleted the
    bogus row.
  - **Tauros**: Paldean breed forms were tagged `Paldean(Fight)`/`(Water)`/
    `(Fire)`, but PokeAPI's real variety names use `combat`/`aqua`/`blaze`
    — the lexical mismatch meant none of the three matched, so all three
    silently fell back to base Tauros's Normal type instead of their real
    Fighting/Fighting-Water/Fighting-Fire types. Renamed to
    `Paldean(Combat)`/`(Aqua)`/`(Blaze)` (the actual in-game breed names),
    which let the existing breed-matching logic resolve them correctly
    with no code change.
  - Ran the slug-stability script again afterward: all 11 disappeared form
    slugs from this round match these fixes exactly, nothing unaccounted
    for.
  - Confirmed **not** bugs: Unown's 28 letters show as `missing-types` too,
    but Unown is genuinely pure Psychic regardless of letter, so the
    placeholder fallback happens to already be correct — cosmetic
    gap-tracking noise, not a real issue.
  - Still open, deliberately untouched (same "no official Z-A mega list"
    deferral as before): the `possible-bogus-form` mega-capable flags for
    Butterfree, Victreebel, Dragonite, Lugia, Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf,
    Malamar, Falinks.
