# Release Checklist

This document is the **canonical owner** for the release workflow. Use this checklist when prepared to ship a new version of the app to friends or staging.

---

## 1. Run Tests & Validation

Ensure the app is fully functional and regression-free before initiating a release:

* Run unit tests (migrations, sync, round-trips):
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```
* Run E2E Playwright smoke tests (boot, settings, stats, export/import):
  ```sh
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
* Run static analysis and lint checks:
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

---

## 2. Version Bump & Changelog

Always bump the app version on master. 

* Choose the bump type:
  * **`minor`** for feature releases (e.g. new tracking options, stats lenses).
  * **`patch`** for bug fixes or pure data corrections.
* Run the version bump script:
  ```sh
  npm run version:bump -- minor  # or patch
  ```
  *(Add `--dry-run` to preview changes without writing them.)*
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > This updates `package.json` semver and `android/app/build.gradle` `versionName` together, and increments `versionCode` by exactly 1.

* Update [CHANGELOG.md](file:///home/nick/Repos/GoBuddy/CHANGELOG.md):
  * Create a new version header matching the bumped semver.
  * Move Unreleased changes under that header with the current date.
* Update feature specifications:
  * Update [features.md](features.md) if any shipped feature scope or planned items changed with this release.

---

## 3. Generate Release Build

The production APK must be release-signed with the stable key to support in-place upgrades.

* Ensure `~/.android-keystores/keystore.properties` is present on the build machine.
* Set the environment variables:
  ```sh
  export JAVA_HOME=/opt/android-studio/jbr   # or wherever JDK 21+ lives
  export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
  ```
* Build the release APK:
  ```sh
  npm run android:release
  ```
  The production APK will be generated at:
  `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (or similar signed name).

---

## 4. Manual Upgrade Verification

Perform a manual upgrade-install check on a physical Android device before distribution to ensure no data-loss or boot-brick bugs were introduced:

1. **Back up current device state:** In the current installed app, go to **Settings → Export** and save a personal data JSON snapshot.
2. **Install new APK over existing:** Sideload the freshly-built release APK.
3. **Verify data survival:** Open the app and verify that:
   * The app boots successfully without DB error screens.
   * All previously-tracked Pokémon achievements and settings are preserved.
   * **Settings → About** shows the updated release version.

---

## 5. Publish & Git Tag

Commit changes and tag the release in git:

* Commit version bump, changelog, and history snapshots:
  ```sh
  git add package.json package-lock.json android/app/build.gradle CHANGELOG.md docs/features/
  git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
  ```
* Create and push git tag:
  ```sh
  git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
  git push origin master --tags
  ```

---

## 6. Distribute

* Deliver the `.apk` file directly to friends.
* **Important Reminder:** Remind users to **export a backup** from Settings before installing the update, as a habit to safeguard personal data.
