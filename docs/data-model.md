# Data model & storage design

Detailed rationale behind the storage architecture and reference-data pipeline.
CLAUDE.md carries the condensed invariants; this file is the full reference.
The *actual* schema is defined in code (`src/db/schema.ts`, `src/db/types.ts`) —
the DDL block below is the reasoned proposal it grew from, kept for the design
rationale in its comments.

## Storage

- **SQLite on-device** via `capacitor-community/sqlite`. No IndexedDB, no
  browser storage — this is a native-wrapped app, so there's no reason to
  target browser-only APIs.
- Two logical groups of tables, separated so that app updates can never
  destroy user data:
  - **Reference tables** — the Pokédex itself (species, forms, mega variants,
    types, regions, backgrounds). Wholesale replaceable on every update. The
    app owns this data, not the user.
  - **Personal tables** — the user's own achievement state. Never written by
    an update, only by user interaction.
- Every reference row has a **permanent, immutable slug** as its primary key
  (e.g. `bulbasaur-standard-male`, `charizard-mega-x`), generated once and
  never reused or reassigned across versions. Personal-data rows reference
  reference rows by this slug (foreign key). This is what makes reference-table
  replacement safe — as long as slugs are stable, updating the dex never
  orphans a user's data.
- All achievement/personal facts are **real boolean columns**, not list
  values or JSON blobs. This was a deliberate reversal from an earlier
  Obsidian-based design that used list properties — that pattern existed
  only to work around Markdown frontmatter's limits and isn't idiomatic for
  a real relational schema. Combined milestones (e.g. a shiny + perfect-IV
  individual, i.e. "shundo") are **independently stored facts, never
  computed from other booleans** — two independently-true flags (e.g. owns
  *a* shiny, owns *a* hundo) do not imply the same individual was both, so
  the combined fact must be its own column, entered/verified independently.
- Include a small schema-version table and a migration runner for personal
  data, so future additions to the personal schema can run a one-time
  migration on load without touching reference data.

## Versioning policy — two separate mechanisms, don't conflate them

There are two independent version numbers in this codebase. Bumping the
wrong one (or neither) when the underlying thing changes is the failure
mode to avoid:

- **`CURRENT_PERSONAL_SCHEMA_VERSION`** (`src/db/schema.ts`) — covers the
  *structure* of the personal tables (`species_personal`, `form_personal`,
  etc.), not their contents. Bump this by hand, and append a matching
  `{ version, up }` entry to `MIGRATIONS` in `src/db/migrations.ts`,
  **whenever a personal-table column is added, removed, renamed, or its
  meaning changes** (e.g. adding a new achievement boolean like
  `four_star_dynamax`). This is also the version number stamped into
  Settings → Export files and checked on Import (see
  `src/data/repository.ts`'s `PersonalDataExport`), so an out-of-date bump
  here would let a structurally-mismatched export get imported without
  warning.
- **`reference_data_version`** (`src/db/reference-sync.ts`) — covers the
  *contents* of `src/data/reference.json` (new species, new forms, new
  costumes, corrected flags, etc.). This one is **automatic** — it's a
  content hash of the whole file, recomputed and compared on every app
  start, and triggers a reference-table wipe-and-reload whenever the file
  changes. **Nothing to bump by hand here**: adding new Pokémon or editing
  existing reference data (via the ingestion pipeline or CSV tools) is
  enough on its own; the version updates itself.

In short: touching `reference.json` (new Pokémon, new forms/costumes, data
corrections) needs no manual version bump. Touching the *shape* of a
personal table in `schema.ts` needs both a `CURRENT_PERSONAL_SCHEMA_VERSION`
bump and a migration entry.

## Suggested schema (starting point, not a mandate)

This is a reasoned proposal reflecting how the game's mechanics actually
work, not a fixed spec. If you (Claude Code) notice something that would be
better modeled differently — a missing edge case, a normalization that
doesn't hold, a game mechanic this gets wrong — propose the change and ask
rather than silently deviating or silently complying. I'd rather be asked
than have you guess.

## Reference data ingestion

- **Asset bundling**: The reference data (`reference.json`) is packaged directly within the application binary.
- **Null safety**: Ingestion scripts and tables are tolerant of missing optional fields, allowing incremental completion.
- **Sync mechanism**: Upon startup, if the bundled content hash doesn't match `reference_data_version`, reference tables are reloaded inside a transaction.
- **Gaps visualization**: An in-app "coverage report" allows tracking missing fields, driving the CSV corrections loop.

For details on running the ingestion scripts, the required sequence, and known pitfalls, see the canonical [docs/ingestion-runbook.md](docs/ingestion-runbook.md).

## Future direction (deferred, not yet built)

These are decisions that have already been made — reasoned through and
deliberately deferred, not open questions. They live here because this is
the database design documentation; refer to [features.md](features.md)
for the active specs and the future roadmap trackers.

### Build-time SQLite generation

The CSV→`reference.json` ingestion pipeline described above already exists
and runs at *authoring* time (`npm run ingest:build`). A further step —
pre-baking an actual on-device SQLite file at *app build* time, instead of
the app performing ~8,100 sequential inserts on first boot/reference-data
update — is a separate, deferred optimization.
`@capacitor-community/sqlite` already exposes `executeSet`/`importFromJson`/
`copyFromAssets`, and `scripts/build-dummy-db.ts` already proves the
prepared-statement bulk-insert pattern works in this codebase; it's just not
wired into the app's boot path yet. **Deferred**, pending real-device timing
data — see [features.md](features.md#planned-deferred-features) for the bulk edit pagination and optimization details.

### Personal/reference database file split

Today's design — one SQLite database, two logical table groups, joined by
permanent slug foreign keys — is what makes reference-table replacement safe
without touching personal data (see "Storage" above). A further step —
splitting personal and reference data into two *physical* database files
instead of one — was considered and **deliberately deferred to V2**, bundled
with the identity/slug rework below. Splitting the files would remove
cross-file FK coupling as a *concern* entirely (a personal row in one file
can't be foreign-keyed to a reference row in another the way SQLite enforces
it today), but that benefit is clearest once identity isn't a slug-derived
string — hence bundling the two. See [features.md](features.md#planned-deferred-features) for the
future roadmap.

### Identity/slug rework

Slugs today are pure display-derived text (`slugify(name/form/costume/gender)`
in `scripts/ingest/slug.ts`) — there's no PokeAPI numeric ID or other stable
identifier persisted anywhere. That's a real fragility (a display-name typo
fix becomes a slug change, which is exactly what the slug-rename registry in
`src/db/slug-renames.ts` exists to patch over) but fixing it is bigger than a
single-version pass, so it's **deferred to V2**. The insight worth preserving:
identity should likely be unified with the image-pipeline's numeric IDs (see
[features.md#4-sprite-asset-pipeline](features.md#4-sprite-asset-pipeline)) — Niantic's own game-master
form/costume ID enum — rather than solving slug-stability and image-matching
as two separate problems. See [features.md](features.md#planned-deferred-features) for the future roadmap.
