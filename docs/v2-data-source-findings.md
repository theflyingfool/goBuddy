# V2 Data Source Findings — pogoapi.net & pokemon-go-api

Phase 0 spike output (see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) §3). Scope was widened
beyond Pokémon species/forms on purpose: V2 also wants player level, medals,
friendship, battle league, and other non-species reference data, so both
sources were surveyed for that too, not just dex data.

---

## 1. Summary

| Source | Breadth | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **pogoapi.net** | Wide — 45 endpoints spanning species, moves, raids, events, and a full player-progression tier (XP, levels, badges/medals, friendship, battle league) | Strong candidate to replace the current PokeAPI+CSV+wikitext pipeline for species/forms, **and** the only one of the two that covers non-Pokémon data we need for V2 |
| **pokemon-go-api** (pokemon-go-api/pokemon-go-api) | Narrow — GameMaster-sourced species/forms, raid bosses, Max Battles, plus generated raid-graphic images | No player progression, medals, items, moves, or PvP endpoints found in the README or docs site. Coverage looks like a subset of pogoapi.net's species/raid data, in a different shape |

**Reading:** pogoapi.net alone gets us both goals — cleaner species/form
ingestion and the previously-uncovered player-progression data. pokemon-go-api
doesn't add anything pogoapi.net doesn't already have for our stated V2 needs;
its main distinguishing feature (generated raid-graphic PNGs) isn't something
we currently use. Recommend treating pogoapi.net as primary and
pokemon-go-api as unnecessary unless a gap turns up during actual
implementation.

## 3. pokemon-go-api — Findings

Much narrower than pogoapi.net; README and docs site describe:

| Data | Contains |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pokémon species/forms | Sourced from the game's GameMaster file via PokeMiners — stats and properties, similar territory to pogoapi.net's species tables but a different JSON shape |
| Raid bosses | Current raid tiers, incl. `shadow_lvl1`/`shadow_lvl3`/`shadow_lvl5` and `ultra_beast` categories not seen broken out this way in pogoapi.net |
| Max Battles | Current Max Battle roster (added Dec 2025) — pogoapi.net has no equivalent endpoint today |
| Raid graphics | Auto-generated localized PNG raid-boss graphics (German/English) — a rendering feature, not raw data |

No endpoints found for: player XP/level, medals/badges, friendship, items,
move databases, PvP rankings, or events. The README explicitly doesn't
document any of these; the underlying GameMaster file may contain fragments
of it, but nothing is exposed as a stable endpoint the way pogoapi.net does.

**Two things pokemon-go-api has that pogoapi.net doesn't:** live Max Battles
data, and the shadow-raid-tier breakout. Worth keeping in mind if Max Battles
or shadow raids become a tracked feature later — otherwise not a reason to
adopt it as a primary source.

---

## 4. Comparison to Current Ingestion

Our current pipeline (PokeAPI + Forms CSV + Gigantamax file + Bulbapedia
wikitext, per [ingestion-runbook.md](ingestion-runbook.md)) only ever
targeted species/form/costume reference data. Everything in pogoapi.net's
**Player Progression** and **PvP** categories above is entirely new ground —
none of it has any equivalent in our schema or pipeline today. That's the
concrete data behind the roadmap's "player level, medals, and a ton of other
things" goal.

Not evaluated in this pass, deferred to actual implementation:
- Exact field-level diff between pogoapi.net's species tables and our
  existing `reference.json` shape.
- Data freshness/update cadence for both sources (neither page states an
  update SLA).
- Licensing/attribution requirements for either source.

---

## 5. Correction: Sprites — pogoapi.net does NOT have them

Checked directly against the live API (all 45 endpoint payloads pulled and
inspected): **no endpoint returns an image URL, sprite field, or icon field
of any kind.** Grepping every downloaded payload for `http…png/jpg/svg`,
`sprite`, `image`, and `icon` keys returned nothing. pogoapi.net is data-only.

The sprite capability actually belongs to **pokemon-go-api**, specifically
its companion repo
[`pokemon-go-api/assets`](https://github.com/pokemon-go-api/assets) (linked
from the main repo's README, not documented in the main API itself) — a
~90MB image repo with a clear naming convention:

```text
Pokemon/pm{pokemon_id}.icon.png              — base form
Pokemon/pm{pokemon_id}.s.icon.png             — shiny variant (.s.)
Pokemon/pm{pokemon_id}.f{FORM}.icon.png       — form variant (e.g. pm100.fHISUIAN.icon.png)
Pokemon/pm{pokemon_id}.c{COSTUME}.icon.png    — costume variant (e.g. pm1.cFALL_2019.icon.png)
```

This is a maintained, ID-keyed sprite manifest with costume and shiny
coverage — a real alternative to our current hand-maintained
`form-sprite-slugs.json` + manual sprite handling. **Recommendation:**
pogoapi.net for data breadth, `pokemon-go-api/assets` for sprites — not an
either/or between the two projects. Not yet checked: license terms, update
cadence, or full coverage vs. our current sprite set.

---

## 6. Costume Data — confirmed present, in pogoapi.net's `form` field

Every per-species-and-form endpoint (`pokemon_stats`, `pokemon_types`,
`current_pokemon_moves`, `pokemon_encounter_data`, `pokemon_height_weight_scale`,
`pokemon_max_cp`, `pokemon_genders`, `pokemon_rarity`) is keyed by
`(pokemon_id, form)`, and costume events show up as their own `form` values
alongside real forms (Alolan, Galarian, Mega, etc.) — there's no separate
"is this a costume" flag, but the values are unambiguous. Example: Pikachu
alone carries 50 form entries in `pokemon_stats.json`, including
`Pop_star`, `Rock_star`, `Doctor`, `Horizons`, `Gofest_2022`,
`Wcs_2022`/`2023`/`2024`/`2025`, several `Summer_2023_*` and `Gotour_2024_*`
variants, `Kariyushi`, `Jeju`, and more — this is the same event-costume
territory our current Bulbapedia-wikitext ingestion step targets, but
already structured as data rather than scraped wikitext.

Not yet resolved: whether pogoapi.net's costume-form names line up cleanly
with our existing costume slugs, or need a mapping table — a real field-level
diff is deferred to implementation, per §4 above.

---

## 7. Sample Payloads (all 45 pogoapi.net endpoints)

One to two real records from each endpoint, pulled directly from the live
API, to ground reference-table design. Full raw JSON retained in the
research scratchpad, not committed to the repo — these excerpts are enough
to design table shape.

### Pokémon Species

```json
{ "1": { "id": 1, "name": "Bulbasaur" } }

```

**`pvp_fast_moves.json`** / **`pvp_charged_moves.json`** (lists, 80 / 233 items) — same shape, PvP-specific fields (`turn_duration`, `buffs`) instead of `stamina_loss_scaler`.

```json
{
  "charged_moves": ["Sludge Bomb", "Seed Bomb", "Power Whip"],
  "elite_charged_moves": [], "elite_fast_moves": [],

  "form": "Normal", "pokemon_id": 1, "pokemon_name": "Bulbasaur"
}
```

### Raids

### Battles / Gameplay Mechanics

**`type_effectiveness.json`** (dict keyed by attacking type, values = multiplier per defending type)
```json
{ "Bug": { "Bug": 1.0, "Dark": 1.6, "Dragon": 1.0, "...": "..." } }
```

**`weather_boosts.json`** (dict keyed by weather) — `{ "Clear": ["Grass", "Ground", "Fire"] }`.

**`cp_multiplier.json`** (list, 89 items, half-levels included) — `{ "level": 1, "multiplier": 0.09399999678134918 }`.

**`pokemon_buddy_distances.json`** (dict keyed by distance-km bucket, e.g. `"1"`) — lists of `{ distance, form, pokemon_id, pokemon_name }`.

  "pokemon_id": 1, "pokemon_name": "Bulbasaur"
}
```
(Note: capture/flee rate showing `-1.0` for this species in the live pull — likely "not set" rather than a real rate; worth checking during implementation.)

### Player Progression

**`player_xp_requirements.json`** (dict keyed by level, 50 keys) — `{ "1": 0, "2": 1000 }` (cumulative XP).

**`levelup_rewards.json`** (list, 67 items)
```json
{ "items_received": [{ "amount_received": 10, "item": "Poké Ball" }, { "amount_received": 6, "item": "Nanab Berry" }], "level": 2 }
```

**`badges.json`** (list, 597 items — this is the medal data)
```json
{
  "description": "Achieve a seven-day Pokémon catch streak or PokéStop spin streak {0} times.",
  "event_badge": false, "name": "Triathlete", "rank": 5, "targets": [1, 10, 50, 100]
}
```
Event-linked badges have no `targets` array, just a description tied to the event (e.g. `"description": "Jeju Island, 2023"`).

**`friendship_level_settings.json`** (list, 5 items)
```json
{
  "allowed_trades": ["Regular Pokémon in Pokédex"], "attack_bonus": 1.0,
  "friendship_level": 0, "friendship_points_required": 0, "name": "Friend",
  "raid_ball_bonus": 0, "trading_discount": 0, "xp_reward": 1500

  "event_moves": [{ "move": "Surf", "move_type": "charged", "pokemon": "Pikachu" }],
  "start_date": "2018-01-20"
}
```

### Infrastructure

**`api_hashes.json`** (dict keyed by filename) — md5/sha1/sha256 per endpoint file, directly usable for our own stale-cache detection the way `reference_data_version` works today.

---

## 8. Cross-Source Identity Risk — confirmed, not hypothetical

pogoapi.net and `pokemon-go-api/assets` are unrelated projects with **no
shared vocabulary for form/costume names.** Checked directly: pogoapi.net's
`pokemon_stats.json` lists Pikachu's costume forms as `Pop_star`,
`Rock_star`, `Doctor`, `Horizons`, `Gofest_2022`, `Wcs_2022`/`2023`/`2024`,
`Kariyushi`, `Jeju`, `Summer_2023_a`..`e`, etc. — pogoapi.net's own
normalized names. The assets repo's file tree for the same species
(`Pokemon/pm25.*`) uses a completely different token set, evidently closer to
Niantic's raw GAME_MASTER costume IDs: `COSTUME_1`, `COSTUME_2`,
`ANNIVERSARY`, `ANNIVERSARY_2022_NOEVOLVE`, `HALLOWEEN_2017`,
`HOLIDAY_2016`, `GOTOUR_2023_BANDANA_NOEVOLVE`, `INDONESIA_2025_NOEVOLVE`.
Neither the names nor the ordering give an obvious 1:1 mapping — e.g. it's
not clear from the strings alone which assets-repo token corresponds to
pogoapi.net's `Doctor` or `Pop_star`.

This means **a name-based join between the two sources will not work
out of the box.** Sprites can't just be looked up by reusing pogoapi.net's
`form` string against the assets repo's filenames — a crosswalk/mapping
table between the two vocabularies is required, built by pairing them up
(likely by release date + event context, cross-checked visually against the
actual sprite images) rather than derived automatically. This is the same
kind of manual-mapping cost our current Bulbapedia-wikitext costume step
already pays — it doesn't go away by switching sources, it just moves.

Two more dimensions the assets filenames carry that pogoapi.net's `form`
field doesn't: a `.g2.` variant (a second rendering/generation of the sprite
for the same costume — meaning likely two costume art passes exist for some
entries) and the `.s.` shiny suffix (independent of form/costume, applies
uniformly). Neither is understood yet — deferred to implementation.

---

## 9. Prerequisites Before Building the New Ingestion Pipeline

Concrete, checkable items — not design decisions — needed before writing
pipeline code, so the pipeline is built against verified facts rather than
assumptions:

1. **Form/costume crosswalk.** Build a mapping table between pogoapi.net's
   `form` strings and the assets repo's `f{FORM}`/`c{COSTUME}` filename
   tokens, for at least the species we currently track costumes for. Confirm
   whether this can be done systematically (e.g. by release-date ordering) or
   needs to stay a hand-maintained table like our current costume lookup.
2. **Coverage diff, species/forms.** Compare pogoapi.net's `released_pokemon.json`
   (937 species) and `pokemon_stats.json`'s 1420 (species, form) rows against
   our current 1024-species dataset and its form count — find species/forms
   we track that pogoapi.net doesn't cover, and vice versa.
3. **Sprite coverage diff.** For the same species/form/costume set, confirm
   the assets repo actually has an icon for every combination we need — check
   for gaps, especially older costumes and the newest ones (upload lag).
4. **Old PokeAPI (pokeapi.co) role check.** Confirm what pokeapi.co gives us
   today that pogoapi.net does not — likely candidates: official main-series
   artwork/sprites (different art style than GO's in-game models, not a
   substitute), Pokédex flavor text, and non-GO-specific taxonomy. If nothing
   pogoapi.net lacks turns up, pokeapi.co likely drops out of the pipeline
   entirely rather than becoming a third source to reconcile.
5. **License/attribution terms** for pogoapi.net, `pokemon-go-api` /
   `pokemon-go-api/assets`, and (for comparison) our current pokeapi.co usage
   — this app bundles reference data and sprites directly into the binary, so
   redistribution rights matter, not just API access.
6. **Update cadence for each source**, including the assets repo's own
   `.last_updated_pokemon_images` marker file — needed to design how the new
   pipeline detects staleness (pogoapi.net's `api_hashes.json` already gives
   us hash-based diffing for its own data; the assets repo needs an
   equivalent check).
7. **New-table shape sketch.** Before writing ingestion code, sketch the
   target schema for the genuinely new categories this data unlocks —
   player-progression (`player_xp_requirements`, `levelup_rewards`, `badges`,
   `friendship_level_settings`), PvP (`gobattle_league_rewards`,
   `gobattle_ranking_settings`), and battle mechanics (moves, `type_effectiveness`,
   `weather_boosts`, `cp_multiplier`, raid data, `community_days`) — so the
   pipeline has concrete tables to populate rather than being designed
   speculatively.

Items 1–4 are comparison/verification work (checking what's real); 5–6 are
source-diligence; 7 is the actual new-table design step, and should come
after 1–6 are answered so the schema reflects verified data, not assumptions.

---

## 10. Resolution: `pokemon-go-api`'s main API already joins forms, costumes, and sprites

Checked the live API (`pokemon-go-api.github.io/pokemon-go-api/api/pokedex/...`),
not just the assets repo — `pokemon-go-api`'s own Pokémon records carry
sprite URLs directly, pre-joined to the same form/costume tokens used in its
filenames, because it generates both from the same GameMaster source. Example
(Pikachu, `id=25`):

```json
{
  "id": "PIKACHU",
  "formId": "PIKACHU",
  "dexNr": 25,
  "assets": {
    "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokemon-go-api/assets/main/Pokemon/pm25.icon.png",
    "shinyImage": ".../pm25.s.icon.png"
  },
  "assetForms": [
    {
      "form": null,
      "costume": "COSTUME_1",
      "isFemale": false,
      "image": ".../pm25.cCOSTUME_1.icon.png",
      "shinyImage": ".../pm25.cCOSTUME_1.s.icon.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

Regional forms come back the same way, keyed under `regionForms` (e.g.
`MEOWTH_ALOLA` → its own `formId`, `stats`, `primaryType`, sprite `assets`,
all self-contained). Evolutions reference the target by `id`/`formId` +
candy cost. Mega/raid data is populated the same way — `raidboss.json`'s
`currentList.mega` entries carry `id`, `form`, `costume`, `assets.image`, and
`dexNr`-joinable identity, no separate lookup needed.

**Net effect: §8's crosswalk problem goes away entirely if `pokemon-go-api`
is the source for species/forms/costumes/sprites.** It doesn't need to be
matched against a second vocabulary because it never used two — the API and
the asset filenames are generated from the same internal IDs. Revised
sourcing split, superseding the "either/or" framing above:

- **`pokemon-go-api`** → species, regional forms, costumes, Mega/Gigantamax
  forms, sprites (regular + shiny, base + costume), and its own raid boss
  list — all pre-joined, no crosswalk needed.
- **pogoapi.net** → everything with no species-identity ambiguity: player
  progression (XP, levels, medals, friendship), PvP league rewards/ranking,
  move stats, type effectiveness, weather boosts, CP multiplier, buddy
  distances, capture/flee rates, power-up costs, community-day history.
- Where both sources describe the same species-linked concept (e.g. both
  have *a* raid boss list, both have *a* Mega Evolution concept), prefer
  `pokemon-go-api`'s version since it's already sprite-linked; pogoapi.net's
  overlapping entries (`raid_bosses.json`, `mega_pokemon.json`) become
  comparison/backfill data rather than a primary source.
- Numeric join key confirmed available on both sides for anything that still
  needs cross-referencing between the two sources: `pokemon-go-api`'s
  `dexNr` and pogoapi.net's `pokemon_id` are the same National Dex number —
  a plain numeric join, not a string-vocabulary problem like forms/costumes
  were.

## 11. Gigantamax Discrepancy — full diff

Per the [full-pull coverage test](v2-pokemon-go-api-full-pull.md): we
currently flag 32 species `canGigantamax`; `pokemon-go-api` flags 15
`hasGigantamaxEvolution`. All 15 of theirs are a subset of our 32 — nothing
in their list is missing from ours, but 17 of ours aren't in theirs.

Pattern worth noting: the 15 that match are exactly the "original" G-max
wave (Gen 1 partners + the initial Gen 8 G-max roster), while the 17 marked
✅/❌ split roughly along "released later" or "event/regional-gated" lines
(Pikachu/Meowth/Eevee G-max were event-exclusive cap-only variants; Melmetal
G-max was a limited Community Day-adjacent release; the rest are
later-wave Gen 8 G-max species). Consistent with the roadmap's existing
theory that our 32 is the full canonical list while a real source reflects
actual in-game rollout — but the exact cutoff logic (event-gated vs.
simply-not-added-yet vs. `pokemon-go-api` lagging reality) still needs a
manual sanity check before this replaces our current data.
