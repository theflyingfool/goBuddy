// Wraps a given SQLiteDBConnection (see sqlite-client.ts for how the real
// app obtains one — same connection object, no change to the native/web
// platform split) in Drizzle's sqlite-proxy driver, so Drizzle's query
// builder and migrator can run against it.
//
// Takes the connection as a parameter rather than fetching sqlite-client.ts's
// own singleton internally, for two reasons: (1) it lets tests inject a
// fixture SQLiteDBConnection (e.g. test/node-sqlite-connection.ts) without
// ever touching sqlite-client.ts, which statically imports jeep-sqlite/loader
// at module load time — a Web-only dependency that fails to resolve outright
// under Node/tsx, breaking every test that transitively imported this file
// when an earlier version called sqlite-client.ts's getDb() internally; (2)
// an earlier version's own module-level singleton (keyed by first call) also
// meant a real app connection, once fetched, stayed cached across every
// later call regardless of which connection the caller actually intended —
// harmless in production (there's only ever one real connection) but a
// footgun that required heavy module-mocking to work around in tests
// (see Task 6's history). No caching here at all now — call this once per
// connection you already have; drizzle() itself is cheap to construct.
